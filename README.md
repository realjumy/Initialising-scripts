# Initialisation scripts collection
This is just a collection of scripts I use for dealing with repetitive and boring tasks. Most of them are intended for initialising servers. I was looking for simplicity rather than functions most of the times.

I hope they are useful for you.

## Before using them:

- Use them __only__ with new freshly intallated systems.
- Always check the version of software, distro, and OS for which the scripts are intended.
- Always check the scripts before using them.
- They try to use as many official sources as possible, avoiding custom repositories. Also, I don't want to do anything I will need to update and maintain.
- I will accept no responsibility if something goes wrong.
